# Automating_email_sending
This script is created in python programming language using Google SMTP service to automate sending emails. 

# How it works?
In the program code you need to add information from your SMTP. Create in a text document the content of the email, pdf file to be sent (in my case it's a resume)

# Set the data to connect to the SMTP server
smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com'
smtp_port = 587
smtp_username = 'your_smtp_username'
smtp_password = 'your_smtp_password'

# What parameters it accepts?
1. PDF file
2. txt file (e-mail content)
3. A list of email addresses, handy for writing to multiple companies.
